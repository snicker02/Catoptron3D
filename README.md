# Catoptron 3D

The 3D counterpart to [Catoptron](https://github.com/snicker02/Catoptron). Same idea — a stack
of coordinate **folds**, assembled into a shader at runtime and cached by signature — but the
folds now bend *space* inside a raymarched distance estimator, so the fold library becomes
fractal geometry instead of image warps.

Single page, no build step, no dependencies. WebGL2.

## The one thing to understand first

In 2D a fold is a **backward map**: bend the coordinate, sample the photo there. Any map at all
is legal, because sampling a texture has no correctness requirement.

In 3D a fold is a **forward domain map** evaluated inside a distance estimator, and the marcher
trusts the returned number as a guaranteed-safe step. So a 3D fold is a map **plus a proof of
how much it stretched space**:

```glsl
vec3 opX(vec3 p, vec4 P0, inout float s, inout vec4 trap);
```

`s` accumulates the operator norm of each fold's Jacobian. The estimator finishes with
`prim(p) / s`. Under-report `s` and rays punch through surfaces; over-report and you only lose
march steps. Every operator declares which case it is:

| `lip` | meaning |
|---|---|
| `exact` | `s` is the true local operator norm, or the map is an isometry and `s` is untouched |
| `bound` | `s` is a proven upper bound but not tight — costs steps, never correctness |
| `repeat` | isometry *within* a cell, discontinuous across cells; valid only while the primitive fits in one cell |

Two consequences that invert the 2D intuition:

- **Many-to-one is still fine.** A kaleidoscope fold makes copies, and copies are free.
- **Expansion is the enemy, not chaos.** A hard-expanding stack made pretty noise in 2D. Here it
  thins the estimate below the true distance and the ray goes *through* the surface. Contraction
  is always safe, which is why the IFS contraction matters even more than it did in 2D.

## Layout

```
index.html          markup + CSS, loads main.js as a module
main.js             state, UI, camera, render loop, PNG export
engine/
  prelude.js        shared uniform block + the DE contract, written down
  helpers.js        GLSL helpers (rotations, primitives, palette)
  ops.js            operator registry — UI params + GLSL together. The file that grows.
  assemble.js       per-config shader assembly, primitives, signature
  glcache.js        program cache, async parallel compile, LRU
tools/
  dump.mjs          dumps op sources + assembled shaders to JSON
  validate.py       the three gates, run against real GL headlessly
```

## Running

ES modules don't load from `file://`, so serve the folder:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000     # then open http://localhost:8000
```

**GitHub Pages:** commit these files with `engine/` next to `index.html`, deploy from branch
root. Pages serves `.js` with the right MIME type.

**Deployment gotcha, carried over from 2D:** deploy `index.html` and the `engine/` modules as a
matched set and hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R). If new controls appear but behave like the old
build, that's a cached module, not a bug. The console logs `[catoptron3d] build <version>` at
startup — check that first before debugging anything.

## What recompiles and what doesn't

Continuous sliders are uniforms and **never** trigger a rebuild. Only the program signature
does:

```
prim | iters | steps | ao | shadow | glow | ops-with-their-discrete-values
```

A param marked **baked** in the UI is a compile-time literal, not a runtime branch. That matters
far more here than in 2D: the fold stack used to run once per pixel, but the estimator is
instantiated ~10× by the compiler (1 march + 4 normal taps + 5 AO taps) and called hundreds of
times per ray. A live branch inside a fold is paid for hundreds of thousands of times per frame.
Features that are off emit no code at all — AO at 0 removes five estimator taps per pixel.

## Adding an operator

One record in `engine/ops.js`: `name`, `fn` matching the GLSL function name, `lip`, `deps` from
`helpers.js`, `params`, and the `glsl`. Then:

- **Bank count must equal `ceil(params.length / 4)`.** Wrong count is a link error.
- **Report `s`.** If you can't derive the operator norm, use a provable upper bound and mark it
  `bound`.
- **No swizzle-write-from-swizzle-read** (`p.xy = p.yx`, `p.yz = M * p.yz`). Some drivers
  silently no-op these and the affected params look dead. Explicit temps only.
- A param with a `names` array is discrete: write `glsl` as a function of the baked values.
- Run the gates.

## Validation

```
node tools/dump.mjs > tools/dump.json
python3 tools/validate.py            # add --canary to prove the gate still has teeth
```

Three gates, all against a real GL driver (Mesa/llvmpipe via EGL), compiling the exact
`#version 300 es` strings the browser gets.

**Gate 1 — compile.** Every op variant × every primitive, plus feature-flag and max-stack
combinations. Catches bank-count drift and signature mismatch.

**Gate 2 — Lipschitz.** For each op, ~200k random points; finite-difference the Jacobian, take
its largest singular value by power iteration on JᵀJ, and assert the declared `s` is not smaller.
Samples that straddle a fold seam are rejected two ways: one-sided derivative disagreement, and
h-refinement convergence. (Comparing reported `s` values across the seam does *not* work — for
an isometry `s` is 1.0 on both sides, so the seam is invisible to that test.)

**Gate 3 — estimator.** The contract directly: from a random exterior point, one full `de(p)`-sized
step in a random direction must not land inside the solid. This is deliberately *not* a comparison
of adaptive vs brute-force marching — that conflates a real violation with the ordinary fact that
a sphere-tracer can step over the thin epsilon shell, and it reports false failures on correct ops.

`--canary` adds an operator that scales by 2.0 and forgets to report it. Gate 2 catches it at
ratio 2.0003. If the canary ever passes, the gate is broken.

### Two known, measured margins

Both are covered by the default step scale of `0.9`, and the gates are calibrated to it:

1. **First-order estimate.** A composition of conformal-but-not-similarity maps (sphere
   inversion, sphere fold) gives a first-order distance estimate, so a small overshoot is
   inherent. Measured worst case on the Mandelbox stack: **9.7%**, i.e. safe up to step scale
   0.912. This is *why* the default is 0.9, rather than a guess.
2. **float32 precision.** Angular folds round-trip through `atan` → `sin`/`cos`. Verified against
   a float64 reference: the sector fold is isometric to 3×10⁻⁹ in double, but loses up to **~4%**
   in float32. Real, not a bug, and it needs headroom.

If a stack ever crawls or shows holes, lower **Step scale** before suspecting anything else.

## Current state — M0

Shipping: the DE contract and assembler, 12 operators (11 exact, 1 cell-local), 5 primitives,
IFS recursion, orbit camera, AO / soft shadows / rim / fog, orbit-trap palette colouring,
progressive resolution, PNG export, and the validation harness.

Next, in order: camera modes and lens projections → materials and single-bounce reflection →
library expansion via the axis-lift wrapper → presets → the 2D post-fold stack → keyframes →
audio reactivity → HQ export with synced audio.

Four constraints are honoured from day one so those later milestones stay cheap: all state is
one flat JSON-serialisable object; `renderScene(w, h)` is the single draw entry point; every
slider declares its real min/max in the DOM; and the build stamp is logged at init.
